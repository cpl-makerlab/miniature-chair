# Design & Make a Miniature Chair

What would life be like without chairs?

The humble chair, at least as we imagine it today, dates back to at least Ancient Egypt and has taken on many different forms throughout history. This simple invention opened up new possibilities for both work and play, and serves many different social functions.

In this tutorial you'll learn how to design a simple chair using Fusion 360. After you learn the steps, you can modify the design to make it your own. 

## Design

Using paper & pencil, first sketch the profile of a chair. Consider who the chair is for, what problem it solves, and where it might be used. Think about the seating angle and how chair proportions relate to the human body and how to support human posture and activity.

**Ergonomics**: Design factors, as for the workplace, intended to maximize productivity by minimizing operator fatigue and discomfort.

**Anthropometry**: The scientific study of measurements of the human body.

[Design is a process](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57c6b79629687fde090a0fdd/t/5b19b2f2aa4a99e99b26b6bb/1528410876119/dschool_bootleg_deck_2018_final_sm+%282%29.pdf) of discovering solutions through observation, imagination, and experimentation. 

Designers often build and test many design prototypes before settling on a final version, as they work through unforeseen problems and limitations that arise.
